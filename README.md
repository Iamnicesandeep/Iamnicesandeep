I’m a Data Scientist with 5+ years of experience applying machine learning, predictive analytics, and data engineering across financial services, manufacturing, and consumer goods. I specialize in Python, SQL, Excel (VBA), Tableau, and AWS/Snowflake, using these tools to build predictive models, Monte Carlo simulations, dashboards, and automated pipelines that improve decision-making and business performance.

⸻

🚀 My Journey
	•	At CNH Industrial, I developed supervised learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest) in Python/SQL using lifecycle and warranty data, improving pricing precision by 22%. I also built Monte Carlo simulations to test premium sensitivity under inflation and equipment complexity, strengthening forecasting and reducing approval cycles by 40%.
	•	At SS&C Technologies, I advanced from Business Analyst to Senior Business Analyst, where I built Tableau/Excel dashboards integrated with AWS and SQL pipelines, improving reporting accuracy to 99% and reducing prep time by 25%. I also developed advanced Excel VBA forecasting models that boosted credit risk classification accuracy to 93% and reduced portfolio defaults by 12%.
	•	Earlier at Lactalis India, I collaborated with finance and strategy teams to build forecasting models and profitability dashboards, uncovering ~$1.52M in margin leakage and driving leadership actions that improved gross margin by 4.2%. Automation through Excel VBA saved 40+ hours per month and improved reporting accuracy.

🎓 Education
	•	M.S. in Business Analytics – University of Wisconsin–Madison (GPA: 3.90)
	•	MBA in Finance – ICFAI University (GPA: 3.24)
	•	B.Tech in Electronics & Communications – K L University (GPA: 3.54)

⸻

🌐 Professional Highlights
	•	Designed supervised ML models and Monte Carlo simulations at CNH to optimize insurance pricing and reduce financial risk.
	•	Built credit risk forecasting models, dashboards, and automated reporting pipelines at SS&C, improving accuracy and reducing defaults.
	•	Developed forecasting models and profitability dashboards at Lactalis, uncovering losses and driving 4.2% margin improvement.
	•	Experienced in SQL, Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost), Tableau, Power BI, Excel VBA, AWS (Glue, S3, Redshift), and Snowflake.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Here’s a snapshot of some of my key projects demonstrating my experience with analytics, modeling, and cloud-based solutions:  

### 📊 Predicting Housing Prices  
Developed a machine learning model using advanced regression techniques to predict housing prices. The model incorporated feature engineering and outlier handling to improve accuracy and provide data-driven pricing insights.  

### 📈 Advertising Strategies & Enrollment Analysis  
Designed an A/B test using Google Search Ads to evaluate marketing strategies for the Actuarial Science Capstone Certificate. Analyzed CTR, engagement, and enrollment data to recommend the most impactful outreach approach.  

### ⚡ EV Charging Station Placement Optimization  
Built a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model to optimize the placement of EV charging stations in Madison. Balanced demand coverage, installation costs, and operational constraints using the CBC solver for cost-effective placement.  

### 🔗 Correlation between COVID-19 and Unemployment  
Analyzed the relationship between COVID-19 case trends and unemployment rates in Wisconsin using Tableau visualizations, revealing sectoral impacts and the effects of policy interventions.  

### 🍔 COVID-19 Impact on Fast-Food Chains  
Integrated Yelp and Kaggle data to analyze changes in franchise counts across 13 U.S. states. Used SQL to uncover trends related to review scores, star ratings, and revenue impacts, highlighting factors influencing closures.  

### ☁️ Prototyping Cloud Architecture for Bankruptcy Prediction  
Designed a scalable AWS architecture (S3, Glue, Redshift, SageMaker) to predict bankruptcy risk using financial ratios. Achieved 95.38% model accuracy and identified key drivers of financial stability.
